# PredictiveMaintenance
Predictive maintenance of aircraft turbine

The example based on the simulated test data and template from Azure AI Gallery(https://gallery.azure.ai/Experiment/Predictive-Maintenance-Step-2A-of-3-train-and-evaluate-regression-models-2).
This template uses the example of simulated aircraft engine run-to-failure events to demonstrate the predictive maintenance modeling process.

There are two modelling solution which are realizes with help of LSTM neural network:

- Regression: Predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL), or Time to Failure (TTF)
- Binary classification: Predict if an asset will fail within certain time frame (in this case cycles).
